# Introduction
The Fernando de Noronha archipelago plays a crucial role as an environmental preservation area for both the state of Pernambuco and Brazil. The local population depends mainly on tourism and fishing for their subsistence. Although it is a paradise-like region, understanding the needs and aspirations of the local inhabitants is essential to develop public policies that promote sustainable tourism and improve the living conditions of the island's residents.

# Data Source
The data was made available by the Island Administration, which belongs to the Government of Pernambuco (www.noronha.pe.gov.br). The dataset comprises 10668 observations. Additionally, data on dengue fever were obtained from datasus, homicide data from states through the Mortality Information System, and GDP data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The combination of these data forms a panel dataset covering the period from 2010 to 2016.

# Analysis Objective
The main objectives of the study are:
1. Verify if the number of homicides and dengue fever cases in Brazilian states impact the number of visitors to the island;
2. Determine which countries send the most tourists to the island.

# Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis: 
1. Using univariate and bivariate analyses to identify patterns and correlations between variables.
2. Inferential statistics: parameter estimation, Regression analysis.
